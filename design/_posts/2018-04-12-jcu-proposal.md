The proposal uses the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio) to redesign the [Joint Communications Unit](http://www.jcu.mil) website. Using the design standards builds upon proven tools and lowers the barrier of use. ASP.NET Core is the backend because the current JCU site uses DNN, a .NET cms. A static site generator could be more useful as the site does not seem to need constant updates.
